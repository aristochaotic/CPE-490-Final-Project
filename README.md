# CPE 490 Final Project
**Tyler Wright**

This repo contains all the submission documents for my final project. The writeup and demo video can be found in the Documentation folder.

The project is a simple Go chat server. Users can log on locally with an email and username and enter the chat room. Most of my code is based on a tutorial I have linked below.

## Setup

No dependencies are necessary other than a Go compiler. Simply clone the repo, navigate to the src folder, and type `go run main.go`. You should then be able to access the chat server via your regular browser by going to `localhost:8000`.
